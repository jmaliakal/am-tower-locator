## AM Tower Locator

The AM Tower Locator is a tool that allows you to determine whether the construction of a proposed tower requires you to notify AM stations prior to construction.

This notification process is required by FCC rules.

For more information about the rules, including the formulas used for calculation and the notification process, please read the [FCCâ€™s order](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2013/db0816/FCC-13-115A1.pdf).
